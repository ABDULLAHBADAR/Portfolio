          Hello there, I'm Muhammad Abdullah Badar, a Full-Stack Developer with a robust skill set that spans across technologies like Ruby on Rails, MERN, as well as SQL and No-SQL databases. My journey into the world of technology began with an academic background in Computer Science, where I discovered a deep passion for programming. The process of writing code, debugging, and ultimately solving complex problems felt like navigating an intricate gameâ€”a challenge I embraced with enthusiasm. This problem-solving mindset is something that not only fuels my work as a developer but also connects with my passion for esports, where strategy and precision are key.

With 4+ years of professional experience, I have successfully completed 30+ projects on Fiverr, consistently earning 5-star ratings for my work. My approach to development is both methodical and creative, ensuring that each project is not only technically sound but also tailored to the specific goals and vision of the client.
